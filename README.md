# Accenture Ticket Requests Portal
Project for SUTD term 5
Worked with Accenture ACNAPI team to create a ticket requests handling web application.

To run web app:
run`npm start` (if first time, run `npm install` first)

To run jest tests:
run `npm test`

To run backend tests: 
1. cd into backend (if first time, run `npm install`)
2. To run integration testing:
  npm `npm run test` 
3. To run unit and robust testing:
  npm `npm run test-server`

NOTE: 
1. Please run `npm install` to install required dependencies before running the application for the first time.
	- Install any dependencies that may not be installed when after running `npm install`
